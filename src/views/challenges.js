                As a newbie I always felt DSA isn&apos;t my cup of tea, I
                thought I will never able to learn DSA, but time did change i
                got to know visualiser that helps understand the working of the
                algorithm s. But I did face difficulties, which were
              </span>
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <span>
                {' '}
                The graphics of the visualiser was not visually appealing which
                made it too boring.
              </span>
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <span>
                {' '}
                There were indicator that the number are being sorted which made
                it difficult to know the working.
              </span>
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <span>
                {' '}
                Also there were no indicators towards the number that were
                sorted.
              </span>
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <span>
                {' '}
                The lack of algorithms, most of the visualiser only had the
                basic 5 algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort,
                Quick Sort, Merge Sort) and the visualisers which had the other
                algorithms had terrible graphics.
              </span>
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <span>
                {' '}
                After understanding the sorting visualiser, I thought lets go
                ahead with Path Finding Algorithm Visualiser, I initially
                thought that, in path finding visualiser there must be a map and
                we need to find the source and destination but I was so
                disappointed after checking a few path finding visualisers I got
                to know, there are no such visualiser available. 
              </span>
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <span>
                Then I got an idea, instead of looking for visualiser, I 
                thought why don&apos;t we build one, not with the intention to
                earn money but to help other don&apos;t face the problems as i
                did.
